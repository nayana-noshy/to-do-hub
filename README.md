To-Do Hub
To-Do Hub is a simple, intuitive task management web application that helps users organize their daily tasks. The app allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks while tracking their progress with a dynamic progress bar that reflects the percentage of completed tasks.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add tasks through an input box.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Tasks can be checked off, and marked as completed, which will apply a strikethrough and update the progress bar.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete (×) button.
Progress Tracker: A dynamic progress bar tracks how many tasks have been completed, along with a percentage display.
Local Storage Support: All tasks and their statuses are saved in the browser’s local storage, so data persists even after refreshing the page.

Usage
Enter your task in the input box and click the "ADD" button to add it to your to-do list.
Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will have a strikethrough and the percentage of completion will be updated.
To delete a task, click the × icon next to it.
The progress bar and percentage text dynamically update as tasks are completed or deleted.
All tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so you can reload the page without losing your tasks.
